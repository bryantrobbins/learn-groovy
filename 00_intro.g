// Computers can actually be very simple. Unlike most things you
// will encounter in life, they do EXACTLY what you tell them to
// do.
// 
// Imagine that you have some errands to run. You write yourself a list:
//   1) go to bank
//   2) get money
//   3) go to grocery store
//   4) buy milk
//
// As long as we know how to get to the bank, how to withdraw money,
// how to get to the grocery store, and how to buy milk, this list
// is probably not very difficult.
//
// Computer programs are very similar. Like our list, programs are an ordered
// sequence of tasks. We write programs in a programming language, and every
// language already knows how to do some very basic tasks. We can combine the
// basics with each other to do more complex tasks. As we combine, we can also
// share our new tasks with each other.
//
// Because of sharing, programming has become easier over time. Languages are
// getting easier, and the bundles of shared tasks (called "libraries") are
// becoming more and more powerful. Writing cool programs in 2015 is so much
// easier than it was even 5, 10, or 20 years ago, because of this.
//
// With that out of the way, let's move on to our very first program - an
// "oldie but a goodie".
