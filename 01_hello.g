// This is a comment.
// We use comments to describe in regular language what our
// programs are actually doing. Comments are very important!
// Any line with these two slashes in front (//) will not be
// read in our programming language, but will just be here for
// us to read and understand the program.

// This line tells the computer to print the phrase "Hello World" on a line
// (hence the name, "print line", shortened to "println")

println "Hello World"

// There are a couple of important programming concepts here. If we are
// thinking of a program as an ordered sequence of tasks, we have one single
// task in this program - print the phrase "Hello World". We are using an
// existing task (called a "function" in our programming language) called
// "println".
//
// The "println" function takes what is called an ARGUMENT for processing.
// As part of processing the argument, it prints it as a line of text on the
// screen. We'll see many more examples of using built-in functions with
// arguments as we go along.
//
// Try running this program with the command "groovy 01_hello.g"
